Guessing Game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

My name is Brandon Parker and this is a Guessing Game that I have built so you can learn all about me! Be unprepared for the random questions that you know nothing about! They will not stump you, hopefully. In the end, you will know ALL about me...

Project Name: Guessing Game
The game consists of 6 questions of either Yes/No answers or a number response.

The files that were used in this game were saved as the following:
  index.html - All of the HTML is contained here (NO WAY!)
  codereview.js - All of the JavaScript is contained here

Within the console, in the browser, contains information on the user's responses and whether or not it was the correct answer.


Joke Time:
Because I am a music guy, I figured this would be a good one ;)

A woman is put on trial for beating her husband to death with his guitar collection.
Judges says: "First offender?"
She says: "No, first a Gibson! Then a Fender!"
